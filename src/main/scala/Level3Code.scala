  // A standard Sudoku puzzle contains 81 cells, in a 9 by 9 grid, and has 9 zones, each zone being the
  // intersection of 3 rows and 3 columns. Each cell may contain a number from one to nine; each number
  // can only occur once in each zone, row, and column of the grid. At the beginning of the game, many
  // cells begin with numbers in them, and the goal is to fill in the remaining cells. -- wikipedia

  // Solve any 9x9 Sudoku board that is input as an array.
  // Array values of 0 represent cells that must be solved for.
  // Array values > 0 must not be modified.
  // To solve: each number 1-9 must exist exactly 9 times, and never in the same row or same column as its self
  // The only valid values are 1-9
  // The more elegant the approach the better

  //<n> sailors are stranded on a desert island with one monkey.
  //The sailors gather coconuts into a pile and go to sleep.
  //
  //That night (without the knowledge of the others) each sailor in turn
  //separates out equal shares of coconuts with one left over (which they throw to the monkey)
  //then they hide their own share and throw the rest back on the pile.
  //
  //The next morning, they all separate the remaining pile and there are no coconuts left for the monkey.
  //How many coconuts did they have in the pile the night before?
